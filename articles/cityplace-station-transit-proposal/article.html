<p>
  Toronto has grown a lot in the last two decades, and everyone knows its
  transit systems have bowed under the pressure of that growth — from an
  increasingly fault-prone subway to streetcars that seemingly come when they
  feel like it.
</p>

<p>
  One of the most visible projects created to improve things has been the
  much-delayed renovation of Union Station, which is now
  <a
    href="https://www.metrolinx.com/en/news/major-construction-starts-on-new-south-passenger-concourse-at-union-station"
    target="_blank"
    >in its final stages</a
  >. However, mention of Union raises a question: Should a city of Toronto’s
  size have to rely on a single city-centre station for all of its needs,
  especially as transformational GO-train service investments are being made to
  better connect the city with its suburbs?
</p>

<ins class="geomodcau"></ins>

<p>
  I for one don’t think so, and so I’m proposing a new city-centre “shoulder”
  station named “CityPlace” after the nearby neighbourhood that embodies our
  city’s condo-driven transformation.
</p>

<p>Read on for why and how I think this station should be built.</p>

<h3>Why Toronto should build CityPlace station</h3>

<p>
  A walk down King or Front St. W. from Union Station is a humbling experience
  as new glass and concrete towers have risen on seemingly every block. Over 70
  per cent of residences in Ward 10 Spadina-Fort York are in high-rise apartment
  towers. But, despite this, high-density transportation is all but absent.
</p>

<p>
  There are several streetcar routes in the area, such as those on King and
  Spadina that are among the most heavily-used surface transit routes in North
  America, but their speed and reliability is a
  <a
    href="https://torontoverse.com/articles/SY6LevM1Ee2BXmbraPuNsQ/tracking-streetcars-to-find-ways"
    target="_blank"
    >perennial problem</a
  >.
</p>

<p>
  The coming

    target="_blank"
    >Ontario Line</a
  >
  will bring more subway service to the city centre, but the line frustratingly
  skirts dense areas like King-Spadina and CityPlace.
</p>

<p>
  In the meantime, massive new developments have only added to the pressure.

    target="_blank"
    >The Well</a
  >
  alone has over 1,500 badly needed housing units, and they’re placed on top of
  a shopping centre that feels like a 21st century version of the Eaton Centre.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to all of the residences are new offices, both at The Well and
  other west-end complexes that form regional destinations, which will only
  become more important as employers seeking hard-to-find talent centralise
  their footprints in Canada’s most accessible location — downtown Toronto.
</p>

</figure>

<p>
  And yet, increasingly, with downtown creeping west, that accessibility can be
  called into question. GO train riders working at The Well, or even attending
  events at the SkyDome (as it’s still known in our hearts), need to walk 15–20
  minutes west from Union Station through crowded passages and on narrow
  sidewalks to their destinations.
</p>

<p>
  And when problems arise at Union, the entire region becomes paralyzed. Local
  transit can’t pick up the slack given the sheer capacity differential between
  300-metre-long double-decker GO trains and narrow streetcars just one-tenth
  the length.
</p>

<p>
  What’s even more frustrating is that if one peers over the edge of the bridge
  crossing the railway tracks at Spadina Ave., they are greeted with a seemingly
  unending flow of trains headed to all sorts of destinations — including
  Pearson Airport, Mississauga, Barrie, and Hamilton.
</p>

<ins class="geomodcau"></ins>

<p>
  Conversely, a rider heading downtown from one of those spots can look up in
  frustration as the train streams past their actual destination.
</p>

<p>
  Union Station is already a perpetually busy site, and that’s only set to
  increase as train service dramatically ramps up to levels never before seen,
  new massive office complexes rise on all sides, and the entire Quebec
  City–Windsor corridor continues to grow.
</p>

<p>
  It needs a pressure-relief valve, and that’s where CityPlace station comes in.

<h3>How Toronto should build CityPlace station</h3>

<p>
  CityPlace station would be a new regional train station on the west end of
  downtown Toronto — just south of Front and Spadina, spanning the array of
  railway tracks. It would be truly revolutionary for access in this
  transit-starved part of town, and it would make use of a truly rare site on
  the GO network — one where trains from all lines run just metres apart.
</p>

<p>
  A new station here would appear as a large open extension of the sidewalk
  along Spadina, which could be accessed in a way that contrasts sharply with
  the labyrinthine underground corridors of Union Station.
</p>

<iframe
  src="https://rmtransit.substack.com/embed"
  class="h-[200px]"
  style="background: white"
  frameborder="0"
  scrolling="no"
></iframe>

<p>
  Unlike at Union, passengers wouldn’t need to wait for the mad rush to a
  platform announced on an overhead screen minutes before their train departure.
  Instead, they could walk in, pass through a fare gate, and descend directly to
  one of three wide platforms serving trains on the Barrie, Kitchener, and
  Lakeshore West corridors.
</p>

<p>
  These platforms would be seeing a lot of trains, as 10-minute-or-better
  service is expected on all of these lines as part of the
  <a
    href="https://www.metrolinx.com/en/projects-and-programs/go-expansion"
    target="_blank"
    >GO expansion program</a
  >.
</p>

<ins class="geomodcau"></ins>

<p>
  Much of the space that would be used to create CityPlace station is currently
  taken up by a rail yard and a rail underpass. Fortunately, changes to the way
  train service is operated on the transformed GO network will make parking
  trains in the yard midday a much less frequent occurrence, while a
  reconsidered routing into Union Station makes the underpass unnecessary — thus
  freeing the space for a station.
</p>

<p>
  While unique in Canada, CityPlace station would be only the latest in a long
  line of similar stations around the world that accommodate additional journeys
  to and from areas adjacent to city centres. In many places — particularly in
  Asia and Europe — it would be unheard of to
  <span class="italic">not</span> have a railway station serving an area as
  dense as CityPlace.
</p>

<h3>Could it really happen?</h3>

<p>
  Of course, the ultimate question remains: Could such a station really be
  built? How much would it cost?
</p>

<p>
  Well, at the moment, plans are actually moving forward for a
  <a
    href="https://www.metrolinx.com/en/news/development-partner-selected-to-transform-front-and-spadina"
    target="_blank"
    >Spadina-Front GO station</a
  >
  in partnership with a private developer who intends to build it along with a
  Front St. W. tower across from The Well. Unfortunately, though, this station
  will only serve trains on the Barrie GO line — not the Lakeshore West, which
  is the busiest line in the system.
</p>

<p>
  Expanding this plan wouldn’t be inexpensive. Based on the cost of the
  <a
    href="https://torontoverse.com/articles/5eXGM4_TQTqrt8dsDjXhYw/in-defence-of-what-remains"
    target="_blank"
    >remaining SmartTrack stations</a
  >, we’d be looking at a likely cost in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
</p>

<p>
  This is a high price to pay, but when you consider how many passengers it
  could serve — particularly during events at the SkyDome — its costs seem less
  extreme.
</p>

<ins class="geomodcau"></ins>

<p>
  Also, as more and more high rises go up nearby, the site will only become more
  expensive to work on the longer we wait. While a station could be built fairly
  quickly on the site as it stands today, the plans for condo development and a
  <a
    href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/rail-deck-district-park-condo-development-1.6846841"
    target="_blank"
    >potential new rail deck district</a
  >
  would seriously complicate things should they not consider provisioning for a
  station.
</p>

<p>
  <strong
    >Long story short: This plan could increase transit accessibility in a
    rapidly growing part of the city, and take a huge load off the shoulders of
    Union Station. But if it’s going to happen, it needs to happen sooner rather
    than later — or else the odds will get stacked too high against it.</strong
