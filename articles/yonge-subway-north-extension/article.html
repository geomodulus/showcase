  The new TTC Line 1 Subway extension is taking another big step forward with
  the release of a tunnelling RFQ. But what is this project, why are we building
  it, and when can we get on board?
</p>

<h3>What we know so far:</h3>

<p>
  The Yonge North subway extension is a planned 8-kilometre extension of
  Toronto's Line 1, more specifically its Yonge side from the longtime terminus
  at Finch station, north along Yonge St., to just beyond Highway 7 at Richmond
  Hill Centre in York Region.
</p>

<p>
  The project is designed in such a way that the subway will begin continuing in
  newly excavated tunnel tubes north into York Region. After passing Royal
  Orchard Blvd, the tunnels will swing east underground, and then back to the
  north to pop above ground next to the GO Richmond Hill Line (discussed in a
  previous article about the “Don Line”). The subway will then continue a short
  distance before terminating at a station called “High Tech”, named after the
  adjacent street at Richmond Hill Centre.
</p>

<p>
  Between Finch and High Tech will be four or five additional stations, at
  Steeles Ave., Clark Ave., Royal Orchard, and “Bridge”; there's also a possible
  station at Cummer Ave.. The stations at Steeles, Clark, and Royal Orchard
  should be fairly standard subway stations; however, as the line will pop above
  ground at the north end, both Bridge and High Tech will be surface stations.
</p>

<p>
  It should be noted that the smart approach for Cummer station is to provision
  for building it in the future, even if not as part of this project. North York
  Centre station was added after the extension to Finch had already been
  completed as development happened around it and something similar could happen
  at Cummer - which is already seeing the massive M2N development.
</p>

<p>
  Bridge station is so named because it will pass under both Highways 7 and 407,
  and bridge the areas on the north and the south. This location is actually
  quite convenient from a transit connection perspective, as Viva BRT buses
  travelling east and west on Highway 7 and GO regional buses travelling east
  and west on Highway 407 will all be able to connect with the subway here.
  There will also be a connection to Langstaff GO on the existing Richmond Hill
  line, which will hopefully be renamed in line with the new subway station.
</p>

<p>
  Interestingly, High Tech station will only be a few hundred metres north of
  Bridge, creating possibly the smallest gap between subway stations on the
  network (the current shortest is between Osgoode and St. Andrew). To the north
  of High Tech will be a small subway yard, which previous plans had
  underground. This yard will be used for storing some trains for use at the
  beginning of service, as well as light maintenance work.
</p>

<p>
  Probably the most visible urban change that will arise from the project
  (especially since the trains themselves will mostly be underground) are the
  two massive planned transit-oriented communities (TOCs) that will be placed
  around Richmond Hill Centre, to the north and south of Highways 7 and 407.
  These developments would include tens of towers, putting thousands of new
  residents within a short walk of the new subway, although they have been
  controversial due to their truly extreme density. That being said, this level
  of vertical density is probably appropriate given the high station density
  being proposed for the area!
</p>

<p>
  The projections for the project call for an eventual daily ridership of over
  100,000, which is high but perhaps not so surprising given the legions of
  buses which run up and down Yonge St. north of Finch station. Taking this
  significant bus traffic off of the streets and removing the dog leg at the end
  of many east-west TTC routes in the area will be a big benefit of the project.
  That being said, if ridership recovery moves at a decent pace, it will be
  critical that the Ontario Line is completed and operational before this
  project, as extending the Yonge Subway northwards will only add to its
  legendary congestion - which the Ontario Line is designed to tackle.
</p>

<h3>What was announced:</h3>

<p>
  Last week, various levels of government and transit authorities came together
  to announce the RFQ for early tunnel works on the project, which is exciting
  but perhaps a bit less so than some might expect.
</p>

<p>
  Metrolinx, in what appears to be a move mostly driven by the delays and high
  costs of projects like the Eglinton Crosstown, has been breaking its new
  subway projects into several smaller contracts rather than a single “mega”
  contract. The idea here is that by creating several smaller projects, more
  companies can throw their hat into the ring, creating more competition and a
  lower price for taxpayers, but this does mean large subway projects will now
  need to be brought together from several smaller components. It's also not
  entirely clear that this strategy is helping Toronto to shake its title as one
  of the most expensive places in the world to build rapid transit.

</p>

<p>
  One of those smaller components is building tunnels - or “advanced tunnel
  works” - for each of the other two subway extension projects Metrolinx is
  currently undertaking (Scarborough Subway Extension & Eglinton West Subway
  Extension), which a separate consortium (a group of companies) has already
  been hired on and begun tunnelling. Separate companies will then be awarded
  contracts to fit those tunnels out with rails and other equipment as well as
  build stations.
</p>

<p>
  In a procurement process, there are typically a number of steps, and the RFQ
  step is not exactly the most consequential. RFQ stands for “Request for
  Qualifications”, and in this step companies apply to be able to bid on the
  project - in this case the advanced tunnel works. It isn’t until the next
  step, known as RFP or “Request for Proposals”, that companies actually bid and
  a preferred construction team is chosen. Nonetheless, progress through this
  process absolutely does matter - and it seems likely that a final contract for
  tunnels could be signed in the next year or two.
</p>

<h3>Costs and Dates:</h3>

<p>
  The Yonge subway extension is meant to be complete in the early 2030s, a few
  years after the Scarborough and Eglinton subway extensions, which makes sense
  given the delay in beginning tunnelling works and the desire for the much more
  complicated (and at risk of delay) Ontario Line to be completed first. Initial
  costing for the project is between 4.5 and 5.8B CAD, but given inflation,
  supply chain challenges, and the complexity of a major transit project as well
  as the risk of delays, that price could easily rise higher.
