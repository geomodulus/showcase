# The great Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area municipality quiz

**Code and markup by Kyle Duncan**

This "article" was an experiment to try different kinds of user interaction as well as a full screen mode, i.e. no article text. At present this is achieved by manually hiding the article window on load. Initially the guesses were typed into a form element, but in adapting to mobile this was converted to a prompt of a municipality name which the user than has to correctly click or tap.
