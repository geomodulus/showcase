  You’ve come to a site called Torontoverse, so at the very least you don’t have
  an aversion to the place — or you came here by mistake. Whatever.
</p>
<p>
  Anyway, now that you’re here, let’s ask a simple question: How well do you
  know the place you may or may not have an aversion to?
</p>
<p>
  More to the point: The Greater Toronto Area is made up of 25 distinct places —
  a mix of urban, suburban, and rural municipalities. How many of them can you
  name?
