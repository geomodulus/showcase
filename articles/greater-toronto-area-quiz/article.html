  You’ve come to a site called Torontoverse, so at the very least you don’t have
  an aversion to the place — or you came here by mistake. Whatever.
</p>

<p>
  Anyway, now that you’re here, let’s ask a simple question: How well do you
  know the place you may or may not have an aversion to?
</p>

<p>
  More to the point: The Greater Toronto Area is made up of 25 distinct places —
  a mix of urban, suburban, and rural municipalities. How many of them can you
  name?
</p>

<p>Take the Torontoverse quiz to find out!</p>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Type the names of each municipality you can remember one by one into the
    empty field below.
  </li>

  <li>
    When you type in a correct one (“Toronto” is kind of a gimme …), that
    municipality will be highlighted on the map.
  </li>

  <li>You will have three minutes to guess them all.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that’s it. When you’re ready, just hit the start button.</p>
