<p>Toronto auto thefts are on the rise — and not in a marginal way.</p>

<p>
  According to recently released Toronto Police Service data, thefts rose for
  the sixth straight year in 2022, jumping 46 per cent from 5,945 in 2021 to
  8,705 this past year. That equates to roughly 24 per day, and is easily the
  highest number in the open database, which dates back to 2014.
</p>

<p>
  This data came out shortly before news broke on
  <a href="https://www.tps.ca/media-centre/news-releases/55906/" target="_blank"
    >Project Stallion</a
  >, the ongoing Toronto Police auto theft investigation, which thrust the
  upward trend even further into the spotlight. As of an April 26 press
  conference, the investigation had resulted in the recovery of 556 stolen
  vehicles worth more than $27 million, and 314 charges laid against 119 people.

<p>
  According to police, thieves use highly sophisticated methods to steal
  vehicles, then use those vehicles to carry out other crimes or ship them
  overseas, where they are resold for well above their value.
</p>

<p>
  “Vehicle theft and its impact on violent crime is a growing issue in Toronto,
  and it can seriously compromise a victim’s personal safety and well-being,”
  said TPS Superintendent Ron Taverner, 22 and 23 District Commander. “Toronto
  Police take these crimes seriously.”

<p>
  Organized Crime Investigative Support Team (OCIS) Detective Sergeant Peter
  Wehby went on to say this issue extends far beyond the confines of our city
  and even the Greater Toronto Area.
</p>

<p>
  “The spike in auto thefts that we are seeing is not exclusive to the GTA,” he
  said. “This is now a provincial, national, and even international problem.”
</p>

<p>
  While police continue to work towards recovering stolen vehicles and holding
  those who commit these crimes to account, we can also peruse the info they’ve
  made available as a way of learning more about the problem.
</p>

<p>
  To help with that, we visualized the latest set of TPS open data. Take a look
  at the map accompanying this article to view thefts by area, and read on for
  our key takeaways.

<h3>Key takeaways</h3>

<p>
  Here are a handful of observations on the latest batch of Toronto auto theft
  data:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Unlike with bike thefts, downtown is not a particularly hard-hit area for
    auto thefts. Instead, a disproportionate amount come from Toronto’s western
    edge.
  </li>

  <li>
    The hardest-hit individual neighbourhood by a long shot is
    <strong class="text-yellow-500"> West Humber-Clairville</strong>, with 672
    thefts — nearly eight per cent of all thefts in the city. The are is
    bordered by Highway 407 in the north, Highway 427 in the west, Highway 407
    in the south, and Kipling Ave. and Martin Grove Rd. in the east.
  </li>

  </figure>

  <li>
    Other neighbourhoods that saw an abundance of thefts include
    <strong class="text-yellow-500"> York University Heights</strong> (196
    thefts), <strong class="text-yellow-500"> Yorkdale-Glen Park</strong> (176),
    and <strong class="text-yellow-500"> Etobicoke City Centre</strong> (162).
  </li>

  <li>
    A whopping 88 thefts are tied to the intersection of Yorkdale Rd. and
    Highland Hill — just south of Yorkdale Mall. That’s the highest number
    attached to a single intersection point in the 2022 database.
  </li>

  <li>
    The overall picture changes slightly if we look at thefts per square
    kilometre. By that measure, the hardest-hit area is
    <strong class="text-yellow-500"> Yonge-Doris</strong> in North York — a
    narrow vertical strip just east of Yonge, between Finch Ave. and Sheppard
    Ave. Here, 0.0741 vehicles were stolen per square kilometre. For context,
    that’s more than three times higher than West Humber-Clairville (0.0223), a
    <span class="italic">much</span> larger area.
  </li>

  <li>
    On the opposite end of the spectrum, four neighbourhoods saw fewer than 10
    thefts each: <strong class="text-yellow-500"> Guildwood</strong> (7 thefts),
    <strong class="text-yellow-500"> Blake-Jones</strong> (8), and
    <strong class="text-yellow-500"> Dufferin Grove</strong> and
    <strong class="text-yellow-500"> North Toronto</strong> (9 each).
  </li>

  </figure>
  <li>
    Guildwood has the least thefts by square kilometre as well, with a minuscule
    0.0018. Others that fall below the 0.003 threshold include
    <strong class="text-yellow-500"> Hillcrest Village</strong> (0.0026) and
    <strong class="text-yellow-500">
      St. Lawrence-East Bayfront-The Islands</strong
    >
    (0.0029).
  </li>

  <li>
    In terms of individual location types that see the most thefts, two stand
    way out in front. Thefts categorized in the database as “outside” (4,278
    thefts) and “house” (3,271) easily lead the pack, not to mention accounted
    for the bulk of the year-over-year rise in thefts.
  </li>

  <li>
    While each category saw at least a marginal rise from 2021, transit and
    educational locations remained the least likely for auto thefts, with 26 and
    eight thefts, respectively.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>How can the average person prevent auto thefts?</h3>

<p>
  As part of the Project Stallion press conference, TPS released a list of
  things that Torontonians can do to protect their vehicle from theft.
</p>

<p>
  For starters, police recommend drivers lock their car doors and close their
  windows, park indoors or in a well-lit area whenever possible, and remove all
  valuable items. They also advice removing FOBs and placing them in a Faraday
  container to avoid them getting cloned.
</p>

<p>
  Other measures include audible alarms, theft-deterrent decals, steering wheel
  locks, ignition kill switches, and tracking devices.
