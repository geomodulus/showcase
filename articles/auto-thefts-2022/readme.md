# We mapped Toronto auto thefts. Here are the hardest-hit areas.

**Code and markup by Kyle Duncan**

This is a data analysis and visualisation based on auto theft data from the Toronto Police Service. There are three aspects to this visualisation, an elevation-based overview of total thefts by neighbourhood, and a colour-based visual of thefts per square kilometer by neighbourhood at lower zoom levels; and a clustered count of individual thefts locations at higher zoom levels.

Popups with more detail appear on click for both neighbourhoods and individual thefts, and the user can view a given year's data using the selector in the legend. Multiple thefts at a single location are collated and ordered in single popup.
