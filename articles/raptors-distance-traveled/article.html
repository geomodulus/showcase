<p>
  On Nov. 9, the Toronto Raptors
  <a href="https://www.nba.com/game/hou-vs-tor-0022200165" target="_blank"
    >beat Jalen Green and his Houston Rockets 116–109</a
  >
  in a game on their home floor.
</p>

<p>
  All-start point guard Fred VanVleet had a game-high 32 points in 35 minutes
  — a performance that was all the more important because the team was without
  star forward Pascal Siakam.
</p>

<p>
  As is often the case, the Raptors ran <i>hard</i>, collecting 23 fast-break
  points to the Rockets’ 19.
</p>

<p>
  But have you ever wondered how <i>far</i> VanVleet and his teammates actually
  traveled over the course of the game?
</p>

<p>
  Thanks to NBA player-tracking software, we know the answer to that. On
  <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats" target="_blank">NBA.com</a>, we can find
  the distance traveled for every player in just about every game. Here’s the
  data for the Nov. 9 Rockets contest:
</p>

  </tr>

  That said, it’s one thing to know Raptors All-Defensive Team candidate O.G.
  Anunoby covered 4.57 km in the game, but ... how far is that, really?
</p>

<p>
  Like, what if instead of moving 4.57 km around the Scotiabank Arena court,
  Anunoby left the building altogether and traveled that same distance through
  the city? Where would he get to?
</p>

<p>
  I mean, he wouldn’t have tied a season-high with 27 points, but he might’ve
  discovered something new.
</p>

<p>
  For fun, we mapped the distance traveled of each Raptor who hit the floor
  against the Rockets using Toronto places of interest as stopping points. Check
  out the visualization attached to this article to see where their legs could
  have carried them.
