  On Nov. 9, the Toronto Raptors
  <a href="https://www.nba.com/game/hou-vs-tor-0022200165" target="_blank"
    >beat Jalen Green and his Houston Rockets 116–109</a
  >
  in a game at their home Scotiabank Arena that was close throughout.
</p>

<p>
  All-start point guard Fred VanVleet had a game-high 32 points in 35 minutes
  — a performance that was all the more important because the team was without
  All-NBA third-team forward Pascal Siakam.
</p>

<p>
  As is often the case, the Raptors ran hard, collecting 23 fast-break points to
  the Rockets’ 19.
</p>

<p>
  But have you ever wondered how <i>far</i> VanVleet and his teammates actually
  traveled over the course of the game?
</p>

<p>
  Thanks to NBA player-tracking software, we know the answer to that. On
  NBA.com, we can find the distance traveled for every player in just about
  every game. Here’s the data for the Nov. 9 Rockets contest:
</p>

  That said, it’s one thing to <i>know</i> Raptors All-Defensive Team candidate
  OG Anunoby covered TK km in the game, but ... how far is that <i>really</i>?
</p>

<p>
  Like, what if — instead of moving TK km around the Scotiabank Arena court —
  — Anunoby left the building altogether and traveled that same distance through
  the city? Where would he get to?
</p>

<p>
  I mean, he wouldn’t have tied a season-high with 27 points, and the team would
  have sorely missed him, but maybe he would have discovered something new.
</p>

<p>
  For fun, we mapped the distance traveled — using Toronto landmarks and places
  of interest — of each Raptor who hit the floor versus the Rockets. Check out
  the visualization attached to this article to see where their legs (could
  have) carried them.
