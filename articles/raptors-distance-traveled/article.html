  On Halloween night, the Toronto Raptors beat/lost to Trae Young and his
  Atlanta Hawks in a game that went down to the final buzzer after 48 minutes of
  play.
</p>

<p>
  As has become their custom as a team with one of the shortest rotations in the
  National Basketball Association, the Raptors’ starters played a huge
  proportion of the contest, each patrolling the floor for at least TK minutes.
</p>

<p>
  After the game, all-star point guard Fred VanVleet gave a TV interview from
  the floor through gasps for air, having run up and down the hardwood dozens of
  times over his TK minutes played.
</p>

<p>
  But have you ever wondered how far he and his teammates actually traveled over
  the course of that game?
</p>

<p>
  Thanks to NBA player-tracking software, we know the answer to that. On
  NBA.com, we can find the distance traveled and average speed for every player
  in every game. Here’s the data for the Oct. 31 Hawks game:

  That said, it’s one thing to know VanVleet covered 4.57 km in the game, but
  it’s another thing to see it.
</p>

<p>
  Like, what if FVV hadn’t moved 4.57 km around the Scotiabank Arena court — but
  instead left the building altogether and traveled that same distance through
  the city? Where would he get to? I mean, he wouldn’t have scored TK points,
  and the team would have sorely missed him, but maybe he would have discovered
  something new.
</p>

<p>
  For fun, we mapped the distance traveled — using Toronto landmarks and points
  of interest — of each Raptor who hit the floor versus the Hawks. Check out the
  visualization attached to this article to see where their legs (could have)
  carried them.
