  On Halloween night, the Toronto Raptors

    >beat Trae Young and his Atlanta Hawks 139–109</a
  >
  in a game that was over a good six or seven minutes before the final buzzer.
</p>

<p>
  After the win, all-NBA third-team forward Pascal Siakam gave a TV interview
  from the floor, having put up 30 points, 12 rebounds, and six assists in 35
  minutes — a performance that was all the more important because the team was
  without all-star guard Fred VanVleet.
</p>

<p>
  “We didn’t give the effort that we usually do last game,” he told Sportsnet’s
  Savanna Hamilton, referring to the Raptors’

  >. “We just had to come out with energy.”
</p>

<p>
  And come out with energy they did. The Raptors blew the doors off the Hawks,
  leading by as many as 35. They also ran hard from the opening tip to the tune
  of 43 fast-break points.
</p>

<p>
  But have you ever wondered how far Siakam and his teammates actually traveled
  over the course of the game?
</p>

<p>
  Thanks to NBA player-tracking software, we know the answer to that. On
  NBA.com, we can find the distance traveled for every player in just about
  every game. Here’s the data for the Oct. 31 Hawks contest:

  That said, it’s one thing to <i>know</i> Raptors super sophomore Scottie
  Barnes covered 4.4 km in the game, but it’s another thing to <i>see</i> it.
</p>

<p>
  Like, what if Barnes hadn’t moved 4.4 km around the Scotiabank Arena court
  — but instead left the building altogether and traveled that same distance
  through the city? Where would he get to? I mean, he wouldn’t have scored a
  season-high 21 points, and the team would have sorely missed him, but maybe he
  would have discovered something new.

<p>
  For fun, we mapped the distance traveled — using Toronto landmarks and places
  of interest — of each Raptor who hit the floor versus the Hawks. Check out the
  visualization attached to this article to see where their legs (could have)
  carried them.
