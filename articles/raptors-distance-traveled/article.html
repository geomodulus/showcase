  On TK night, TK DATE, the Toronto Raptors beat/lost to TK and his TK TKs in a
  game that went down to the final buzzer after 48 minutes of play.
</p>

<p>
  As has become their custom as a team with one of the shortest rotations in the
  National Basketball Association, the Raptors’ starters played a huge
  proportion of the contest, each patrolling the floor for at least TK minutes.
</p>

<p>
  After the game, all-star point guard Fred VanVleet gave a TV interview from
  the floor through gasps for air, having run up and down the hardwood dozens of
  times over his TK minutes played.
</p>

<p>
  But have you ever wondered how far he and his teammates actually traveled over
  the course of that game?
</p>

<p>
  Thanks to NBA player-tracking software, we know the answer to that. On
  NBA.com, we can find the distance traveled and average speed for every player
  in every game. Here’s the data for the TK DATE TK OPPONENT game:

  That said, it’s one thing to know VanVleet covered TK km in the game, but it’s
  another thing to see it.
</p>

<p>
  Like, what if FVV hadn’t moved TK km around the Scotiabank Arena court — but
  instead left the building altogether and traveled that same distance through
  the city? Where would he get to? I mean, he wouldn’t have scored TK points,
  and the team would have sorely missed him, but maybe he would have discovered
  something new.

<p>
  Here is a visualization of the distance traveled — using Toronto landmarks and
  points of interest — by each Raptor who hit the floor in the TK DATE game
  versus TK OPPONENT.
